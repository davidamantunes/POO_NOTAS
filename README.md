# POO_NOTAS

This repository contains short notes I take during classes and while studying **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

These notes are personal summaries meant to help reinforce key concepts, lab exercises, and important topics covered throughout the course.

> Topics may include classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more.

Feel free to explore and use them as a reference if you're also studying OOP!
